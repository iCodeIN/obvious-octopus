        In the case of undirected graphs, only O(n) time is required to find a cycle in an n-vertex graph, since at most n âˆ’ 1 edges can be tree edges.

                A cycle consists of a sequence of vertices starting and ending at the same vertex, with each two consecutive vertices in the sequence adjacent to each other in the graph.
                In a directed graph, each edge must be traversed by the walk consistently with its direction:
                the edge must be oriented from the earlier of two consecutive vertices to the later of the two vertices in the sequence.
                The choice of starting vertex is not important: traversing the same cyclic sequence of edges from different starting vertices produces the same closed walk.
