            A cycle consists of a sequence of vertices starting and ending at the same vertex, with each two consecutive vertices in the sequence adjacent to each other in the graph.
            In a directed graph, each edge must be traversed by the walk consistently with its direction:
            the edge must be oriented from the earlier of two consecutive vertices to the later of the two vertices in the sequence.
            The choice of starting vertex is not important: traversing the same cyclic sequence of edges from different starting vertices produces the same closed walk.
