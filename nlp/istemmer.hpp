    /*! In linguistic morphology and information retrieval, stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root formâ€”generally a written word form.
        The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word;
        it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root.
        Algorithms for stemming have been studied in computer science since the 1960s.
        Many search engines treat words with the same stem as synonyms as a kind of query expansion, a process called conflation.
