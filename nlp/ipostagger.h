        is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech,
        based on both its definition and its contextâ€”i.e., its relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase, sentence, or paragraph.
        A simplified form of this is commonly taught to school-age children, in the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.
